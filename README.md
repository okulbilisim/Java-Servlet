 - What is REQUEST and RESPONSE process in Servlet?

 ![](http://i.imgur.com/SfhPrRx.jpg)
 
 Request/Response is the most basic and common of the client-service interaction patterns. It is used when the client must have an immediate response or wants the service to complete a task without delay. Request/Response begins when the client establishes a connection to the service. Once a connection has been established, the client sends its request and waits for a response. The service processes the request as soon as it is received and returns a response over the same connection.

 - GET and POST methods

 	- **GET** Requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect. (This is also true of some other HTTP methods.) The W3C has published guidance principles on this distinction, saying, "Web application design should be informed by the above principles, but also by the relevant limitations."
	- **POST** equests that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the web resource identified by the URI. The data POSTed might be, for example, an annotation for existing resources; a message for a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or comment thread; a block of data that is the result of submitting a web form to a data-handling process; or an item to add to a database.
